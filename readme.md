# Welcome to my week 4 assignment where we have to make a 5 question quiz!

- The goal of this assignment is to create a quiz game, where the user begins the quiz, and chooses from a set of answers to move on to the next question.

- However, if the question is wrong, the user will have time reduced from their remaining time.

- Once the game is over, the user will be able to type in their name and save their score to the leaderboard!


## Repo Structure
The repo is structured in this manner:
- The assets folder contains the css styling and java script, as well as the leaderboard page.
- Outside of that is the readme and the main page (index.html)

## Credits
- I had a lot of help from my brother.
- I had some assistance from classmates in brainstorming ideas.
- I used chat gpt to help explain and give me baseline examples to work around or think about.
- I used w3 schools for various bits of info that I forgot about or needed a refresher on
- I utilized looking at notes that i've taken during class
- I had a tutor session!
