# Welcome to my week 4 assignment where we have to make a 5 question quiz!

- The goal of this assignment is to create a quiz game, where the user begins the quiz, and chooses from a set of answers to move on to the next question.

- However, if the question is wrong, the user will have time reduced from their remaining time.

- Once the game is over, the user will be able to type in their name and save their score to the leaderboard!


## Repo Structure
The repo is structured in this manner:
- The assets folder contains the css styling and java script, as well as the quizPage image
- Outside of that is the readme and the main page (index.html)
